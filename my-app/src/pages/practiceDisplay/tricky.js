//1. Write a function that reverses the order of words in a sentence without using the built-in reverse() method.

//2. Implement a function that checks if a given string is a palindrome (reads the same forwards and backwards) while ignoring whitespace and punctuation.

//3. Write a function that takes an array of integers and returns the largest difference between any two numbers in the array.

//4. Implement a function that removes duplicates from an array, keeping only the unique elements.

//5. Write a function that accepts a number and returns its factorial (e.g., factorial of 5 is 5 x 4 x 3 x 2 x 1).

//6. Implement a function that flattens a nested array into a single-dimensional array.

//7. Write a function that checks if a given string is an anagram of another string (contains the same characters in a different order).

//8. Implement a function that finds the second smallest element in an array of integers.

//9. Write a function that generates a random alphanumeric string of a given length.

//10. Implement a function that converts a number to its Roman numeral representation.
